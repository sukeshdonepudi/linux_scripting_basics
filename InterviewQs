# Interview Q's

## AWS:
1. What are the most commons services that you used in AWS
Ans: EC2, EBS, CloudWatch, S3 Buckets, Route53[DNS solution in AWS], IAM, VPC, CLoudFront.

2. What is EC2, Did you managed them manually or any automated way.
Ans: 
- EC2 - Elastic Cloud Compute, is VM in AWS environment. We have different types of EC2 instances in AWS like t2.micro, t2.small, c3.large and etc. 
- We created EC2 instances based on developer application memory and CPU requirements.

- I worked creating EC2 instances manually and also automated way using ansible-playbooks.

Manual way:
- Goto AWS console
- Choose EC2 service and region on the top right corner, where you want to launch instance. Click NEXT
- Click on create instance and choose instance type[as per dev's requirement]. Click NEXT
- Select VPC and SUBNET[Private/Public]. Click NEXT
- Add EBS Volume, if they need extra disks excluding ephemeral storage. Click NEXT
- Choose keys if you have any or create new key pair which helps to login to the instance, once it is UP and healthy. Click Review and Create.

Automated way:
- Write ansible playbooks with respective roles and tasks which includes set of steps to spin up EC2 instance in AWS Console.

3. What is a Key pair that you use while creating EC2 instances
Ans: 
- It helps us to login to the instance after we created it. Its a .pem or .rdp file.
- We better save them in a safe place like GitHub or BitBucket[What ever we use]

4. How do you login to a Ubuntu EC2 instance
Ans: I use SSH to login to EC2 ubuntu insatnce.


ssh hostname -i KeyFile (If DNS is configured)

(or)

ssh IPAddress -i KeyFile (If no DNS Configured)

5. If SSH fails while login to EC2 instance, what do you do.
Ans: I will check, why the instance login fail using -vvv options

Command: 
ssh IpAddress -i KeyFile -vvv

-vvv : It takes the SSH to debug mode, we can use -v as well.

In debug mode it will give some hints, whether instance is reachable or not. Or if there any issues related keys permissions.

6. Where we keep the SSH keys in your local work station.
Ans: We store key files in .ssh folder, which located in our home directory[$HOME]


7. What is EBS
Ans: 
- EBS[ElasticBlock Storage] is a block storage, It stays until we delete from EC2 instance in AWS console.
- By default EC2 instances comes with ephemeral storage, which is limited to instance[Say 32Gb, 64Gb]. If we want to create a extra disk, we can use EBS service to create an extra disk and attach it to EC2 instances.

8. Why we use S3[Simple Storage Service] buckets. 
Ans:
- You can use the S3 interface to store and retrieve any amount of data. It works on payment model is "pay as you go" means no limits for storage.
- In general we use it for static data[Which is consistanant, no change in data]
- For few applications, We might need to store more data on daily basis. We use S3 buckets to store the data.

9. Difference between EBS and S3.
Ans:
- EBS: Administrator creates it with limited storage[Like 50Gb or 100Gb]. EBS volumes are limited to regions.
- Where as S3 is unlimited storage and S3 buckets can be shared between the AWS regions.

10. What is a VPC
Ans:
- Its a Virtual private cloud. Which helps us to seperate/safeGaurd our AWS resources from OutSide network. 

11. How do we setup VPC
Ans:
Create VPC -> 
Create InternetGW and attach to VPC -> 
Create public/Private subnets and attach to VPC -> 
Create routeTables[Default public RT created attach IGW and PublicSubnet, create privateRT and assosiate PrivateSubnet] ->
Security -> Network ACL & SG 


12. What is AutoScaling, where do you setup in AWS console.
Ans:
- AutoScaling helps us to increase or descrease EC2 instances in AWS depends on respective resource usage.
- Some times the CPU or memory usage may grow depends on the traffic on those EC2 instances, We can set the limits on ELB[Elastic Load Balancer]
- If the CPU or Memory usage is > 80% on the ELB level, it creates a new EC2 instances to overcome the resource shortage issues.


13. What is ELB
Ans: 
- Elastic Load Balancer
- It balance or sends the traffic to under lying instances in a round robin way.

14. Why we need to use route53.
Ans:
- It a DNS solution in AWS Cloud.
- We can create DNS records like A, AAAA, TXT, MX etc. in route53.
- Here 53 is DNS service port number.
- We can expose our application endpoint with domains to out side world by setting DNS records in AWS.

15. CloudWatch
Ans:
- AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring solution that AWS provide to resources.
- We can monitor and create alerting to our mobiles/emails/Slack channels by usaing AWS SNS[Simple Notification Service] service.
- We can monitor Ec2 instance health. Whether instance is UP or Down etc.


16. CloudFront
Ans:
- AWS CloudFront is a CDN service in AWS.
- It helps keep the static data available at AWS edge data centers, so that data and application pages are accessible with faster response.





## ANSIBLE:

1. What is ANSIBLE
Ans:
- It is a configuration managemant tool.
- We can create and update any configuration accross many servers at a time.

2. Which backend mechanism ANSIBLE use.
Ans:
- It uses SSH and it is developed in python.
- If SSH is configured on remote instances to be accessible from your local instance, using ANSIBLE you can make changes as per the requirements.

3. Do we need master and slave servers for ANSIBLE
Ans:
- ANSIBLE is agent less, we no need to have master and slave setup.
- We just need to have SSH setup to use ANSIBLE.

4. How do you run dry run in ANSIBLE
Ans:
- We can use --check option to run dryRun in Ansible PlayBook

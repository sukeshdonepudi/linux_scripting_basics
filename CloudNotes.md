#### What is Cloud:

Cloud Computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources(e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- It is accessible to all the users (proper credentials) without any restriction.
- Using the cloud for applications is cost-efficient.
- Least the possibility of access failure due to non-dependency on a single machine.

#### Virtualisation:
- A Virtualization is a Software that creates “separated” multiple images of the hardware and software on the same machine. 
- This makes possible to install multiple OS, multiple software and multiple applications on the same physical machine.

## Key Differences Between Cloud Computing and Virtualization:
- Cloud computing is best to access from outside the office network while Virtualization meant to access from office only.
- The cloud environment is accessible through URL so it can be accessed outside work premises (Depending upon permission).
- Cloud computing works on IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) while virtualization is based upon SaaS (Software as a Service).
